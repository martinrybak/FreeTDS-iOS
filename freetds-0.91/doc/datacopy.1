.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdatacopy\fP is a utility distributed with FreeTDS. 
\fBdatacopy\fP will move table data from one server to another without
the need for intermediate files. \fBdatacopy\fP is much faster
and more efficient than is freebcp out/in.
.PP
\fBdatacopy\fP makes use of the db-lib bcp API built into FreeTDS. This 
API is also available to application developers.
.PP
\fBdatacopy\fP can be used to migrate data between Sybase ASE and SQL Server
or vice versa.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP
Truncate target table before loading data.
.TP
.B
\fB-a\fP
Append data to target table.
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fP \fIowner\fP
Create the target table with the same schema as the source
table. \fBdatacopy\fP will submit a 'create table' command on 
the target server/database using the specified \fIowner\fP in 
.RS
.TP
.B
the command, e.g. CREATE TABLE \fIowner\fP\.table (\.\.\.).

to the database. The default is 1000. 
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP \fIpacketsize\fP
